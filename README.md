## Installation

The recommended method of installation is through [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

    pip install aiida-pyscf

## Requirements

To use `aiida-pyscf` a configured AiiDA profile is required.
Please refer to the [documentation of `aiida-core`](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/get_started.html) for detailed instructions.

## Setup

To run a PySCF calculation through AiiDA using the `aiida-pyscf` plugin, the computer needs to be configured where PySCF should be run.
Please refer to the [documentation of `aiida-core`](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/howto/run_codes.html#computer-setup) for detailed instructions.

Then the PySCF code needs to be configured.
The following YAML configuration file can be taken as a starting point:
```yaml
label: pyscf
description: PySCF
computer: localhost
filepath_executable: python
default_calc_job_plugin: pyscf.base
use_double_quotes: false
with_mpi: false
prepend_text: ''
append_text: ''

```
Write the contents to a file named `pyscf.yml`, making sure to update the value of `computer` to the label of the computer configured in the previous step.
To configure the code, execute:
```bash
verdi code create core.code.installed --config pyscf.yml -n
```
This should now have created the code with the label `pyscf` that will be used in the following examples.

## Examples

### Mean-field calculation

The default calculation is to perform a mean-field calculation.
At a very minimum, the structure and the mean-field method should be defined:
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code

builder = load_code('pyscf').get_builder()
builder.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('H2O'))
builder.parameters = Dict({'mean_field': {'method': 'RHF'}})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
This runs a Hartree-Fock calculation on the geometry of a water molecule.

The main results are stored in the `parameters` output, which by default contain the computed `total_energy` and `forces`, details on the molecular orbitals, as well as some timing information:
```python
print(results['parameters'].get_dict())
{
    'mean_field': {
        'forces': [
            [-6.4898366104394e-16, 3.0329042995656e-15, 2.2269765466236],
            [1.122487932593e-14, 0.64803103141326, -1.1134882733107],
            [-1.0575895664886e-14, -0.64803103141331, -1.1134882733108]
        ],
        'forces_units': 'eV/â„«',
        'molecular_orbitals': {
            'labels': [
                '0 O 1s',
                '0 O 2s',
                '0 O 2px',
                '0 O 2py',
                '0 O 2pz',
                '1 H 1s',
                '2 H 1s'
            ],
            'energies': [
                -550.86280025028,
                -34.375426862456,
                -16.629598134599,
                -12.323304634736,
                -10.637428057751,
                16.200273277782,
                19.796075801491
            ],
            'occupations': [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0]
        },
        'total_energy': -2039.8853743664,
        'total_energy_units': 'eV',
    },
    'timings': {
        'total': 1.3238215579768, 'mean_field': 0.47364449803717
    },
}
```

### Customizing the structure

The geometry of the structure is fully defined through the `structure` input, which is provided by a `StructureData` node.
Any other properties, e.g., the charge and what basis set to use, can be specified through the `structure` dictionary in the `parameters` input:
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code

builder = load_code('pyscf').get_builder()
builder.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('H2O'))
builder.parameters = Dict({
    'mean_field': {'method': 'RHF'},
    'structure': {
        'basis ': 'sto-3g',
        'charge': 0,
    }
})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
Any attribute of the [`pyscf.gto.Mole` class](https://pyscf.org/user/gto.html) which is used to define the structure can be set through the `structure` dictionary, with the exception of the `atom` and `unit` attributes, which are set automatically by the plugin based on the `StructureData` input.

### Optimizing geometry

The geometry can be optimized by specifying the `optimizer` dictionary in the input `parameters`.
The `solver` has to be specified, and currently the solvers `geometric` and `berny` are supported.
The `convergence_parameters` accepts the parameters for the selected solver (see [PySCF documentation](https://pyscf.org/user/geomopt.html?highlight=geometry+optimization) for details):
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code

builder = load_code('pyscf').get_builder()
builder.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('H2O'))
builder.parameters = Dict({
    'mean_field': {'method': 'RHF'},
    'optimizer': {
        'solver': 'geometric',
        'convergence_parameters': {
            'convergence_energy': 1e-6,  # Eh
            'convergence_grms': 3e-4,    # Eh/Bohr
            'convergence_gmax': 4.5e-4,  # Eh/Bohr
            'convergence_drms': 1.2e-3,  # Angstrom
            'convergence_dmax': 1.8e-3,  # Angstrom
        }
    }
})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
The optimized structure is returned in the form of a `StructureData` under the `structure` output label.
The structure and energy of each frame in the geometry optimization trajectory, are stored in the form of a `TrajectoryData` under the `trajectory` output label.
The total energies can be retrieved as follows:
```python
results['trajectory'].get_array('energies')
```

### Writing Hamiltonian to FCIDUMP files

To instruct the calculation to dump a representation of the Hamiltonian to FCIDUMP files, add the `fcidump` dictionary to the `parameters` input:
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code

builder = load_code('pyscf').get_builder()
builder.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('N2'))
builder.parameters = Dict({
    'mean_field': {'method': 'RHF'},
    'fcidump': {
        'active_spaces': [[5, 6, 8, 9]],
        'occupations': [[1, 1, 1, 1]]
    }
})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
The `active_spaces` and `occupations` keys are requires and each take a list of list of integers.
For each element in the list, a FCIDUMP file is generated for the corresponding active spaces and the occupations of the orbitals.
The shape of the `active_spaces` and `occupations` array has to be identical.

The generated FCIDUMP files are attached as `SinglefileData` output nodes in the `fcidump` namespace, where the label is determined by the index of the corresponding active space in the list:
```python
print(results['fcidump']['active_space_0'].get_content())
 &FCI NORB=   4,NELEC= 4,MS2=0,
  ORBSYM=1,1,1,1,
  ISYM=1,
 &END
  0.5832127121682998       1    1    1    1
  0.5359642500498074       1    1    2    2
 -2.942091015256668e-15    1    1    3    2
  0.5381290185905914       1    1    3    3
 -3.782672959584676e-15    1    1    4    1
  ...
```

### Generating CUBE files

The `pyscf.tools.cubegen` module provides functions to compute various properties of the system and write them as CUBE files.
The `PyscfCalculation` plugin currently supports computing the following:

* molecular orbitals
* charge density
* molecular electrostatic potential

To instruct the calculation to dump a representation of any of these quantities to CUBE files, add the `cubegen` dictionary to the `parameters` input:
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code

builder = load_code('pyscf').get_builder()
builder.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('N2'))
builder.parameters = Dict({
    'mean_field': {'method': 'RHF'},
    'cubegen': {
        'orbitals: {
            'indices': [5, 6],
            'parameters': {
                'nx': 40,
                'ny': 40,
                'nz': 40,
            }
        },
        'density': {
            'parameters': {
                'resolution': 300,
            }
        },
        'mep': {
            'parameters': {
                'resolution': 300,
            }
        }
    }
})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
The `indices` key has to be specified for the `orbitals` subdictionary and takes a list of integers, indicating the indices of the molecular orbitals that should be written to file.
Additional parameters can be provided in the `parameters` subdictionary (see the [PySCF documentation](https://pyscf.org/pyscf_api_docs/pyscf.tools.html?highlight=fcidump#module-pyscf.tools.cubegen) for details).
The `parameters` subdictionaries for the `density` and `mep` dictionaries are optional.
To compute the charge density and molecular electrostatic potential, the and empty dictionary for the `density` and `mep` keys, respectively, is sufficient.

The generated CUBE files are attached as `SinglefileData` output nodes in the `cubegen` namespace, with the `orbitals`, `density` and `mep` subnamespaces.
For the `orbitals` subnamespace, the label is determined by the corresponding molecular orbital index:
```python
print(results['cubegen']['orbitals']['mo_5'].get_content())
Orbital value in real space (1/Bohr^3)

> **Warning**
> PySCF is known to fail when computing the MEP with DHF, DKS, GHF and GKS references.

### Restarting unconverged calculations

The plugin will automatically instruct PySCF to write a checkpoint file.
If the calculation did not converge, it will finish with exit status `410` and the checkpoint file is attached as a `SinglefileData` as the `checkpoint` output node.
This node can then be passed as input to a new calculation to restart from the checkpoint:
```python
failed_calculation = load_node(IDENTIFIER)
builder = failed_calculation.get_builder_restart()
builder.checkpoint = failed_calculation.outputs.checkpoint
submit(builder)
```
The plugin will write the checkpoint file of the failed calculation to the working directory such that PySCF can start of from there.


### Automatic error recovery

There are a variety of reasons why a PySCF calculation may not finish with the intended result.
Examples are the self-consistent field cycle not converging or the job getting killed by the scheduler because it ran out of the requested walltime.
The `PyscfBaseWorkChain` is designed to try and automatically recover from these kinds of errors whenever it can potentially be handled.
It is a simple wrapper around the `PyscfCalculation` plugin that automatically restarts a new `PyscfCalculation` if the previous iterations failed.
Launching a `PyscfBaseWorkChain` is almost identical to launching a `PyscfCalculation` directly; the inputs just have to be "nested" inside the `pyscf` namespace:
```python
from aiida.engine import run
from aiida.orm import Dict, StructureData, load_code, load_node
from aiida_pyscf.workflows.base import PyscfBaseWorkChain
from ase.build import molecule

builder = PyscfBaseWorkChain.get_builder()
builder.pyscf.code = load_code('pyscf')
builder.pyscf.structure = StructureData(ase=molecule('H2O'))
builder.pyscf.parameters = Dict({
    'mean_field': {
        'method': 'RHF',
        'max_cycle': 3,
    }
})
results, node = run.get_node(builder)
```
In this example, we purposefully set the maximum number of iterations in the self-consistent field cycle to 3 (`'mean_field.max_cycle' = 3`), which will cause the first iteration to fail to reach convergence.
The `PyscfBaseWorkChain` detects the error, indicated by exit status `410` on the `PyscfCalculation`, and automatically restarts the calculation from the saved checkpoint.
After three iterations, the calculation converges:
```console
$ verdi process status IDENTIFIER
PyscfBaseWorkChain<30126> Finished [0] [2:results]
    â”œâ”€â”€ PyscfCalculation<30127> Finished [410]
    â”œâ”€â”€ PyscfCalculation<30132> Finished [410]
    â””â”€â”€ PyscfCalculation<30137> Finished [0]
```
The following error modes are currently handled by the `PyscfBaseWorkChain`:

* `120`: Out of walltime: The calculation will be restarted from the last checkpoint if available, otherwise the work chain is aborted
* `140`: Node failure: The calculation will be restarted from the last checkpoint
* `410`: Electronic convergence not achieved: The calculation will be restarted from the last checkpoint
* `500`: Ionic convergence not achieved: The geometry optmizization did not converge, calculation will be restarted from the last checkpoint and structure
